30112022 Dream 

* It is evident that seeing has nothing to do with eyes since some extremely vivid and detailed dreams might shock one person, for the rest of the day. 
* At the same time, among all the attributes, there are some **Strong Identifiers** and the rest are **weak identifiers**, which when appears in the dream, mostly the Strong one, shapes the rest of the trajectory of the dream. 
* Since no inhibition or control is manifested in unconsciousness, like in dream, slips or habitual responses - one can think of them as **geodesics of neuromanifold**, which is just the dream  - where we can consider the **strong identifiers** to be analogical with heavily massive bodies, which interferes with the trajectory most. 
* The details I noticed today, makes me want to stay into that apparent reality - although that is nothing but the outburst of my repression, that has been under process for months. 
* But why are they so vivid? and, Why the sequence is precisely as it is? or even, What might have originated that figure along the road, where no such references were made along the way? - In short, what is the logical structure behind Repression and Unconsciousness?

Freud said - "Repression, in psychoanalytic theory, is a defense mechanism used by the ego to keep disturbing or threatening thoughts from becoming conscious." 
What happens as a consequence of Repression according to Freud ? - According to Freud, repression is a defence mechanism used to protect the individual from anxiety-inducing thoughts or feelings. Repression occurs when the individual pushes away certain thoughts or feelings that are too difficult to deal with. This can lead to problems in the individual's life if they are unable to deal with these difficult thoughts or feelings. Some of the consequences of repression, according to Freud, can include: 

-The individual may have difficulty dealing with certain emotions or situations.
-The individual may have trouble relationships with others.
-The individual may turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as substance abuse, to try to deal with the difficult thoughts or feelings. 
-This can lead to chronic problems like depression, anxiety, and addiction.
-However, if the individual does not look for help and is not diagnosed with PTSD, the problems associated with it can last for years.
-Many people who deal with trauma do not go through all of the symptoms of PTSD.
-Some people may feel symptoms for only a short period of time while others may feel the effects much longer.
-Within three months of the traumatic event most people will either get better or develop PTSD.
