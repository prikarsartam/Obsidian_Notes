1. Introduction :

  

It is hard and possibly impossible to distinguish between the presentation and a representation of any state of affair. At the same time, it is evidently impossible to distinguish between the nuances of a phenomenon, and its abstract representation when the redundant degrees of freedom are beyond the scope of observability . Yet the validity and necessity of a sense underlies its falsifiability - which when further sensed through experience, affirms degenerately, the reason followed. Therefore, in being capable of making intelligible sense out of any sensible worldly phenomenon, a cognitive faculty requires a-prioris and reasoning to proceed to a posteriori episteme. This being the basic framework of generating sense, one further hinges upon the skepticisms of the uniqueness and choices of a-prioris with that being interacted with the trajectory of reasonings.

                                        When we have come along this far with the epistemological groundwork over the principle of sufficient reasoning [1](https://cogito-journal.github.io/pritam_2.html), from the time of Liebniz, Spinoza, Kant, later on Schopenhauer and recently Kripke - we claim the totality of universal possibilities, never to outperform the totality of language. That being the case, we irresistibly and innately consider reason to be the only thing in itself - where among many, the logic of nature is one certain case, with possibilities of being degenerately many. That is clearly where we consider the different laws of nature, with parameters only changed from static to anything dynamic. A clear visualisation would be to keep any physical equation unchanged except varying any constant in it, which will produce a distinct motion that isn’t captured inside the preconceived law(s) of nature. Therefore the supposition that the reason in language is sufficient enough to capture the reason in nature, is rudimentary in epitomising phenomena in natural science. What follows in this article, with the exposition of foundational questions in the epistemological basis of science and sense; will be directed towards a Science of Sense. 

  

2. Concretizing the Context : 

  

                       The necessity of distinguishing what can be said to be true or, what appears to be true and what is true is fundamental is understanding the sufficiency of language and the totality of senses. This is further involved in dissecting logical necessity and natural necessity corresponding to a possibility in the category of thoughts. The sole purpose of being sceptical regarding nature, reason and language is their virtues of explainability, with arbitrary coherence; although with enough room for inconsistency always . We must not take for granted the ability to speak and sense; as this is the key ingredient behind saying - There is at least one Universe with theories about the Universe in it, where the sole originator is nothing but beings like us, with common-enough intelligibility. It’s phenomenal how a thing like ‘language’ and ‘reasoning’ came about under very spontaneous planetary morphisms, and is capable enough to produce possibilities beyond the constraints of this planetary nature - i.e. you can imagine, say or write about yourself flying in the sky; or anything arbitrary, since language necessarily totalizes all things that can be said, or are apparently true.   

                                Therefore further question arises - what essential features does an expression must satisfy in order to be coherent enough to appear as a truthful possibility? The question hinges around things that can be said but has nothing to do with what is strictly possible in nature. This is the section of representability of expressions in every I-Language, where it seems to us that - thoughts generated in cognitive-faculties can be such that its truth, defies natural constraints or laws of nature, although being a very consistent sense, i.e. I am swimming in the clouds - is logically consistent and makes proper sense - but can never be a natural possibility. Thus it is obvious, and depicts the emergence of un-nature from within nature with the whole process of emergence still being a natural one, and will be exploited later on.

                                                 This article concerns the distinction and relation of Logic of Nature, meaning the immanent reasoning of natural phenomenon as far as we’ve been able to make sense of yet, and Nature of Logic, meaning the coherent reasonable constructions that we analytically perform as a cognitive agents. Here logic is not necessarily encapsulated within propositional systems - [which should preferably be reducible logic, since the system is the consequence of countably many a-priori truths which means that every possibility in the system can be reducible to countable-knowledge] - rather is the general scheme of reasonability, that which gives birth to logic. Now, in order to proceed further, it is necessary to clear the ground for the scope of Nature(in) of Logic and Logic of Nature(ex). Some notational clarifications are along the way : 

Logic - An unambiguous construction to reason [that whose structure is independent of representation].

Nature (in = Intrinsic) [of a thing] - that which (attribute(s)) are immanent to a thing/being. 

Nature (ex = extrinsic) - that which is outside [the universe that encompasses the trees I look outside].

  

-   Note that there are two Natures in the discourse, and you can, in principle, consider the Nature(in) of Nature(ex) and this possibly, if constructed solely from an analytical and dialectical basis, will be the Ultimate Theory of Nature. 
    

  

3. Nature(in) of Logic :

It's not arbitrary to choose to mention Nature of Logic before Logic of Nature since - as I have conveyed in my previous article [1] - sense originates in a cognitive-facility and the rest of the intelligible world is a representation through that. As Chomsky significantly proposes the immanence of innate characteristics, those that generate conceptions from event and preconceptions Somewhere in this trajectory, there lies the rudimentary structure of reasoning as an a-prior basis of epistemology, which is wished here to capture essentially as the intrinsic nature of logic and reasoning. 

             Logic allows the paradigm which can be reducible into countably many simple situations, and every possibility being the combination of those simple possibilities. So, deductibility to reducibility is my road to generalise the scope of logic, in which the Turing Machines represent the reducible possibilities. In every way, I must acquire an unambiguous system to reason about a possibility. [Plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-information/#:~:text=First%20published%20Mon%20Feb%203,actions%20or%20operations%20conceived%20broadly) writes regarding Logic and Information - Logic is the study of consequence, which when unwrapped, means - The consequence of some apriority, originated through a certain choice . 

          There is a remarkable exposition on the ontology of logic, i.e. the structure and nature of logic by Immanuel Kant, in is [Lectures on Logic [2]](https://cdchester.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lectures-on-Logic-The-Cambridge-Edition-of-the-Works-of-Immanuel-Kant-in-Translation-Immanuel-Kant.pdf) :  

  

Everything in nature, in the inanimate as well as the animate world, happens according to rules, although we do not always know these rules. Water falls according to the laws of gravity, and the locomotion of animals also takes place according to the rules. The fish in the water, the birds in the air move according to the rules. All nature actually is nothing but a nexus of appearances to rules; and there is nothing at all without rules. When we believe we have come across an absence of rules, we can only say that the rules are unknown to us . . . . . If now, we set aside all cognition that we must borrow from objects and reflect solely upon the use of the understanding itself, we discover those of its rules which are necessary throughout, in every respect and regardless of any special objects, because without them we would not think at all. Insights into these rules can therefore be gained apriori and independently of any experience, because they contain, without discrimination between objects,merely the conditions of the use of the understanding itself, be it pure of empirical. And it also follows from this that the universal and necessary rules of thought are in general can concern solely its form, and not it anyway its matter.. . . . In logic we do not seek how presentations arise but solely how they agree with the logical form.

                                  This embodies the subject-insensitive logical-connectivity between a reason of thought and a matter in thought. When considering a science of sense or broadly the horizon of sensibility further restrictions from actuality is confronted, and suitably tackled with the following measures as Kant envisions: The science of the necessary laws of the understanding and reason in general or - which is the same - of the mere form of thinking, we call - the Nature(in) of Logic. This, along with the necessity of this becoming a doctrine we require: 

  

As a science concerning all thinking in general regardless of objects as the matter of thinking, Logic of to be considered as  [2](https://cdchester.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lectures-on-Logic-The-Cambridge-Edition-of-the-Works-of-Immanuel-Kant-in-Translation-Immanuel-Kant.pdf) : 

-   Basis of all other sciences, and the propaedeutic of all use of the understanding,
    
-   The organon of the sciences,
    
-   As a science of the necessary laws of thinking, without which no use of the understanding and of reason takes place at all, which consequently are the conditions under which alone the understanding can and shall agree with itself. These are necessary laws and conditions of its right use….. It must contain nothing but laws apriori that are necessary and concern the understanding in general,
    
-   As a science of reason not as to mere form but as to matter, since its rules are not taken from experiences and since at the same time, it has reason as its subject matter. Logic is therefore a self-cognition of the understanding and of reason, not however, as to their faculty in respect of objects but solely as to form. In logic I shall not ask: what does the understanding cognize and how much can it cognize or how far does the cognition go? But only how will the understanding cognize itself,
    
-   As a doctrine or a demonstrated theory. 
    

  

With this fundamental requisite for the necessity of Logic we can move onto Nature and its ontology , and later on make the inevitable knot between them transparent. 

  

4. Logic of Nature(ex) :

                                       Since an extrinsic material existence is universal on solely the empirical basis, there is no possibility to consider the Represented Reality as the primary mode of existence, which rather, must be considered as the aftermath (epiphenomenon) of observation made by cognitive-agents [1] . Therefore the system that seeks for the particular sufficient reason behind a truth, that is naturally possible, is the supposed aim of Logic of Nature(ex); where a logical representation of the extrinsic nature is what we seek. Philosophers from past had anticipated metaphysics to capture this section of episteme due to their limitation of mathematics and experimentation at that period of enlightening philosophy; but now when we understand the discrepancies in our Theories of the Universe quite thoroughly at this period of development, we conclude that nothing metaphysical exists in Nature, and all that is naturally possible is physical, and Physics is always responsible to guarantee a sufficient reason behind so. 

                                               Physicist Carlo Rovelli [4] concerns that the Nature can very well be devoid of thing but must be totalized by relations which are fundamentally constitutive to existence in the most generality. Therefore, a thought is a Relation between Cognitive events and reality is the Relation between Real events. [I don’t require to how cognition is related to nature, i.e. I do not need to know how the structure of cognition as apriori, and will reach at a possibility of the structure based on the functions of cognition we study in this article. ] Also, a thing means an instance whereas relations are sequential, giving the better scope for probing causality, which is fundamentally sequential. 

  

The logic of Nature concerns the representation of complexity which governs Nature (as the totality). Nature is, in this sense, simply a complex phenomenon and that certain complexity is the ontology underlying. Consider two sets R and T, where R is the set of all real relations among things and R is the set of all thinkable relations among things as in a thinkable world which says then R is the Real World. Considering the material universe as the Actual Nature or the whole Real World, then clearly natural events will outnumber the thinkable events; but in many ways distant parts of the universe aren’t causally affected so therefore we have a scale of causality that generates an element of the thinkable world, or that it dynamically potential to affect a thought. But what is our reality, now? It isn’t static, and it never was. It has now morphed into an Effective Real World E(R) within which the thinkable possibilities hugely outnumber the (effectively) real possibilities, which leads us to formulating an ordering between thinkables and effective-reals, as  

  

                    thinkable relations > effective real relations

  

Some remarks: about how the representation of nature as a giant complexity would lead to a logic of nature, are as follows : 

-   Physics as it has been, reducible and deterministic didn’t allow for the scope of emergence and critical phenomenon, where contemporary development of Renormalisation Theory emphasises that the Complex Phenomenon are imminently irreducible into simple ones, which gives the appearance of Scale Dependence. Remarkably, Spinoza anticipated this picture as he wrote in his Ethics [3] 
    

  

There is a scale of complexity in the mental domain of desires and the perceptions matching the scale of complexity among physical objects.                             - Intro., Ethics

  

-   Complexity leaves much less room for absolute computability and greater room for undecidability, and this is a measure of complexity in such systems . 
    
-   The primary distinction between nature and logic is that nature is contingent but logic isn’t - therefore logic of nature must account for the contingencies in nature, whereas, nature of logic must take into account a situation strictly devoid of contingencies.
    
-   Logic being a deductive system in any way, with only rules for deduction only differing for systems, cannot be contingent, since then impossibility will be just another possibility, implying there’s no point in deduction as there will always be undetectable chances of a deduction being nonsense; regarding which Kant exposits : 
    

  

All rules according to which the understanding proceeds are either necessary or contingent. The former are those without which no use of the understanding would be possible at all; the latter are those without which a certain use of the understanding would not take place. 

  

                  - Logic, Kant, 1819

-   Nature cannot be freely regular or freely contingent either, since the former would imply classical determinism, which we know not to be true, and the later would leave us with absolute law-lessness which isn’t what we experience and as what Kant established, somewhere in the dynamics there’s a cut-off and scaling relation, bounded by the totality of the Effective Real Relations E(R) [that which governs the unique causality behind a particular event]
    

  

We can further anticipate analytically and transcendentally on many Countability, Continuity and Compositionality of the sets R and T  which are respectively sets of all real relations and thinkable relations. That must require another investigation altogether, but with the analysis at hand, we have successfully been able to map the question of Logic of Nature ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Xzo1erjDCJZpKYJEQeEDKUEQmOnAgEBy47Sn7Rx5SIDLvvmTIXWehR2QnI_LF6PyM9jodKSWvYvBP2kQ6nC_Y5grn0XiTMlT2b9Ex8i8Jwspnr3SVAzszT-c3XhTzVtAlwSxTXJju2ClYOUIAenPwnapzwE8_BYBvmWYxMxh5RV70YbrViiXe51tSA05Xhxa) Nature of Logic into the distinction of Turing Systems and Representation of  nature as a giant complex phenomenon by looking at it dynamically. 

  

4.1 Turing Systems : 

                                                              Turing machines are turing-complete systems, but the Turing System as I mention here is a quite different object. It is a system for probing the fundamental nature of Deductive and Inductive Systems. [Logic is being induced in the system and that’s where Syllogism, which is actually a simple deductive system finds its differences from logical induction]. 

                                                   Thus logic as we’ve built it isn’t an instance or a thing, it is a system, but nature is altogether the whole thing, and complexity allows contingency at each level of spontaneity which makes nature un-smooth as fractals. Our empirical evidence hugely validates that, in fact with heavy ubiquity. On the other hand, the analytical construction of Turing Systems can be quite dilemmatic but we can speculate a possibility. Given a formal system, the truths that are intuitional but unprovable from within the system are the ones that are Unprovable truths, and Turing Systems T:(P, S, N) -> {0,1} therefore probes the Nature of Logic at its fundamentals. Further studies on this matter might lead us to Geist Ist Immanent Unentscheidbar, as Turing himself considered Oracle Machines, in parallel with mind.

          At one end we have a thing and then the sense of the thing. In fact there are many things that exist only through the sense of it, with no form at the physical level [2, God and all such humane constructions exist only in its sense and not by consuming any physical volume at all]. That is the reason language allows you to make poetry and stay formal both, although at distinct ends of a Superspectrum. Episteme is this superspectrum - the totality (spectrum) we can generate in making senses (Both a derogatory and sophisticated use of language have sense but has distinct styles, which aren’t universal and won’t be bothered by us - meaning that content of an expression in language, if represents a real phenomenon, must not depend on how it’s been said or the representation). 

  

5. Reason is the only thing in itself :

                                                   Kant’s distinction of noumenon and phenomenon is at the heart of Universal Ontology, which says - regarding any intelligible acquisition of sense, there can only be representation of the thing in itself in terms of a phenomenon or the thing for itself, thereby the noumenon is strictly out of the episteme and all we have are its functions as in how it interacts with everything else. Considering how Rovelli [2] puts forward his - Relations are all there is, we have the clarity that thing has nothing to do with reality, indicating that the parallelism between thing & noumenon would give us equivalently consistent ontology as what Kant and Rovelli prescribed. But still, as I consider the logic of nature(ex) the general presupposition underneath is that, the reason in nature is immanent and strictly indifferent to the choice of representation of the observer[1], which is another extension of Universality of Natural Laws, given a definite scale of interaction [for emergentism and scale-dependence of physical laws, look at [1] as it contains detailed exposition on this matter]. Further on, Spinoza, in his Ethics proposes: 

  

-   It is of the nature of reason, to regard things as necessary, not as contingent
    

  

Which sufficiently demonstrated the scope of reasonability as well as the horizon of our cognition, since beyond that, there must always persist an undetectable possibility that a deduction is absolute nonsense, and thus no consequence of the reasonable (logical) system can be considerably upheld to be a truth. Therefore what remains in front of us, is the scope of immant reason which is intrinsic to every relation in certainty, giving us : reason is the only thing in itself (to the sense) whereas, everything else is an appearance due to relational causation.

  
  

Conclusion [ as Inevitability in Logic ‘=’ Necessity / Spontaneity in Nature ] : 

  

This development naturally leads us to how logical inevitability and natural spontaneity can be put into a coherent framework to construct a Science of Sense, and totalising the episteme and the universe under one system, i.e. through distinguishing and relating the Logic of Nature ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Xzo1erjDCJZpKYJEQeEDKUEQmOnAgEBy47Sn7Rx5SIDLvvmTIXWehR2QnI_LF6PyM9jodKSWvYvBP2kQ6nC_Y5grn0XiTMlT2b9Ex8i8Jwspnr3SVAzszT-c3XhTzVtAlwSxTXJju2ClYOUIAenPwnapzwE8_BYBvmWYxMxh5RV70YbrViiXe51tSA05Xhxa) Nature of Logic. It begs attention why such a symbol, of whose answer is the following - The equivalence isn’t present, although the Nature of Logic, as we conceive it, must originate from the predisposed Logic of Nature through emergence and criticality. 

Yet there is significant room for questions regarding uniqueness of sense and objects which nature alone cannot accommodate, and different flavours of logical paradigms are necessary there for an universal consistency of the superspectrum.  Kant further mentions regarding this : 

  

..before the question whether the cognition agrees with the object, must come the question whether it agrees with itself (as to form). And thus is the business of Logic: 

-   The principle of contradiction
    
-   The principle of sufficient reason
    

By the former is determined the logical possibility, and by the latter, the logical actuality of Cognition. 

                             - Thoroughness of Cognition, Lectures on Logic, Kant [2]

  

With broader clarification of aforementioned scheme in [1], the article is concluded with a motivation towards a Reasonable Categorification of Natural Relations, with ambitious aims towards the Science of Sense, the language of the Universe, and the theory of Origin of Nature which is supposed to be born in upcoming sessions.
