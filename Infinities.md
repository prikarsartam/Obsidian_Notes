## Induction

Consider an Infinity which is Infinitely bigger than any other infinity, which is to say aleph_infinity is the cardinality of the set which is infinitely bigger than any other infinity - the metric over infinities. 

$$\aleph_{0}< \aleph_{1} < \aleph_{2} ... \implies \aleph_{i+1}=2^{\aleph_i}$$
Extending this inductively, we can obtain $\aleph_{\aleph_0}$ where the cardinality of the infinity has been extended upto countable infinity - which now is the **Infinity that is infinitely bigger than all the infinities**.
Can there by any such things as - $\aleph_{\aleph_{1}}< \aleph_{\aleph_{2}}< ...$ upto $\aleph_{\aleph_{\aleph_0}}$, there induction allows us to form a ladder of possible cardinalities, which we represent as Infinities, like - 
$$\aleph_{\aleph_{\aleph_{\aleph_{._{._{._{._{._{._{.}}}}}}}}}}$$
**This is the Horizon of Perception**

## Representation 

Whatever be the size of an infinity, it can still be symbolised into some finite representation, which captures the essential ingredient of consciousness as the origin of abstraction.
