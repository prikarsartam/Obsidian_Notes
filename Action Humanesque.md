Google's Knowledge base #GNN in regards with [[Learning Graph Representations]] and [[GNN - Graph Neural Networks]] is now the powerful machine to generate the `would be possible desire` from the `desires previously availed` - which in terms of machine learning, the learnability of individuals by **model**-ing _their behaviour_. 
		Therefore not only democratizing the #KnowledgeBase of Google, from the monopolized `free hand` of silicon-valley to the people, who have been `modelled` inadvertanely, without knowledge.\

The Graphical model of individuals and their estimated nature of interaction further produces the possible desires by means of machine learning. 

* One unified approach towards modelling individuals must be from the very birth of one, when every attribute will be captured and one sufficiently complex neural network will be trained to capture the sufficient statistics of the several aspects of that individuals. Poeple can extend therefore, the Humanity - but with costs to be very responsible on, from the very beginning.

He who discontinues feeding own models newer and newer forms (of knowledge and in nature) will be discontinued from the access of his model while considering that to be a crime of misuseage.
