[Information Philosopher](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/about/)

A short and detailed introduction of Information Philosophy and its origin is as follows : 

Information Philosophy is a new way of thinking about reality, knowledge, and value that is based on the fundamental idea that information is the key to understanding the world. This philosophy was first proposed by  [Bob Doyle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Doyle) in the early 1980 s, and has since been developed and elaborated by a number of other thinkers.

The basic premise of Information Philosophy is that everything in the universe can be understood in terms of information. This includes not only physical things like particles and waves, but also abstract concepts like ideas and values. All of reality can be seen as a vast network of information, with each thing or event being a node in this network.

Information Philosophy rejects the notion that `we can know things for certain.

Information philosophy accepts the notion that we can never know things for certain, but we can know things with varying degrees of probability.
